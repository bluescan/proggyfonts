The "ProggyVector Regular" font is a modified version of the Hack Font. The modifications were made using the Bird Font editor. Both the modifications made by SourceFoundry for Hack and my subsequent modifications are licensed under MIT. However, Hack started life out elsewhere, so please read the licensing information below. There's nothing arduous. 

I have ONLY tested the non-Mac ttf and otf files in Windows. I have NOT tested the included svg and eot files. A web format woff file may be generated by importing the otf into FontForge and exporting. I have also included the BirdFont (.birdfont) project files in case anyone would like to make further edits.

In my opinion, Windows did a better job rendering the ttf version over the otf version (even though the otf supports cubic beziers which should not be approximations of the authored curves). I'm using the ttf in any case.
