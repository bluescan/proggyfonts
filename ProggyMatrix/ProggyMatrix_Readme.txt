ProggyMatrix is a cubic-spline font visually based on ProggyClean and ProggyVector. It is MIT Licensed (only). ProggyMatrix has fewer glyphs compared to ProggyVector but benefits from a clean MIT License stack.

ProggyMatrix was created with FontForge. At version 20251009 as of 2026-01-11.
ProggyMatrix currently only includes the first 256 Unicode glyphs (ISO8859-1)

To tag the font as monospaced in FontForge:
* Select Element -> Font Info -> OS/2
* Under Misc set PFM Family to Monospace.
* Under Panose set Proportion to Monospaced.

Other FontForge notes:
* In Font Info -> Lookups the kerning info is in GPOS. It has been removed for monospace.
* In Font Info -> PS Names make sure the Versions and names match what you see under TTF Names.
* FontForge cannot create embeddable EOT files. To do so use the online tool here (https://www.kirsle.net/wizards/ttf2eot.cgi) and drop the generated ttf file there.
